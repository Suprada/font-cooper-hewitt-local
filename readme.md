# font-cooper-hewitt-local

A version of the open source [font Cooper Hewitt](https://www.cooperhewitt.org/open-source-at-cooper-hewitt/cooper-hewitt-the-typeface-by-chester-jenkins/) using locally available font files.

If you are like me, and love beautiful typography, and like to develop websites offline, then you would have run into this problem: Using web-hosted fonts makes you want to tear out your hair when working offline. The solution to that is, of course locally hosted fonts. You can do this yourself of course, but when there is a bower package for this, why take the trouble to write all this code?

How to install:

via Bower: bower install --save font-cooper-hewitt-local

Then include in your HTML file:
    <link rel="import" type="text/css" href="../bower_components/font-cooper-hewitt-local/cooper-hewitt.html">
